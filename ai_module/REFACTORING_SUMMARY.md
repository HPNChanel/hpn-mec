# AI Module Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during the refactoring of the AI module.

## Major Changes

1. **Fixed Import Path Issues**
   - Added proper `__init__.py` files to all directories
   - Standardized relative imports (`from ..module import X`)
   - Created central imports in package `__init__.py` files
   - Added fallback imports for robustness

2. **Standardized Directory Structure**
   - Ensured all models save to `ai_module/models/`
   - Ensured all processed data goes to `data/processed/`
   - Created `data/processed/latents/` for latent vectors
   - Created `data/processed/scores/` for anomaly scores

3. **Code Improvements**
   - Added type hints to function parameters and return values
   - Fixed variable naming for consistency
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Made imports more explicit and controlled
   - Added better documentation

4. **Added Missing Functionality**
   - Created placeholders for future LSTM and XGBoost implementations
   - Improved data loading through centralized DataLoader class
   - Added proper model checkpoint naming and versioning
   - Fixed threshold optimization in Isolation Forest

5. **Documentation**
   - Added inline documentation for all functions
   - Created README with usage examples
   - Added requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - Created this summary document

## File Changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `__init__.py` files | Added to all directories for proper package structure |
| `data_loader.py` | Created central redirector to preprocess implementation |
| `models/autoencoder.py` | Created dedicated model definition file |
| `train/train_autoencoder.py` | Fixed imports, added proper error handling |
| `train/train_isolation_forest.py` | Fixed imports, standardized paths |
| `inference/handlers/*` | Added placeholders for LSTM and XGBoost |
| `train/*` | Added placeholders for LSTM and XGBoost training |

## Usage Improvements

The refactored code now allows for:

1. Running scripts as modules: `python -m ai_module.train.train_autoencoder`
2. Centralized data loading: `from ai_module.data_loader import DataLoader`
3. Consistent model loading: `from ai_module.inference.handlers import autoencoder_handler`
4. Consistent output paths for all models and processing steps

## Future Work

The following could be improved in future iterations:

1. Complete implementation of LSTM and XGBoost models
2. Add more comprehensive unit tests
3. Better hyperparameter optimization utilities
4. More extensive input validation for the API
5. Additional visualization tools for model analysis
